    <h2>About the Game</h2>
    <p>We have created a game called “Sanguine,” which means blood red and optimism. It is a race against time, as you try to dodge obstacles and last as long as possible yb collecting sanitary products as time boosters. In our game, we used ice as our enemy because it worsens menstrual cramps. The higher times reached within the game,the more money and products sponsors will donate to those who cannot afford them.</p>

    <h2>How-To-Play</h2>
    <p>Sanguine is a 30 second game with a goal of trying to reach the greatest distance while also not hitting into a ice cubes. Each ice cube you hit, you will lose 2 seconds. You can get time back by trying to collect one of the three power ups, which are a pad that gives you an extra 4 seconds, the tampon gives you an extra 8 seconds, and the menstrual cup gives an extra 12 seconds.</p>

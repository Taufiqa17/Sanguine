  <h1>Socioeconomic issues and Stigmas around Menstruation</h1>
  <div id="Period Poverty">
    <h2>Period Poverty</h2>
    <p>Period poverty is a global issue that deals with the limited access of menstrual sanitary products. Many people around the world doesn't have access to period products due to cost, community stigma, and sanction. Menstrual products are still though of as a “luxury” despite being one of the greatest necessities of a woman. Due to limited resources sometimes a menstrual product may be used for a prolonged time period or using rags which can lead to an infection. About 50% of girls in Kenya doesn’t have access to period products.</p>

  <div id="Stigma round Menstruation">
    <h3>Stigma around Menstruation</h3>
    <p>Menstruation is stigmatized around the world. In a lot of places, women that are menstruating are mistreated and given labels like impure. They are banished to their homes and girls are banned from leaving the houses a lot of thetime. This became a big issue in Nepal, women are banished to huts which is technically illegal, but families believe in such superstitious because of myths and misconceptions that have been passed through generations. In a study conducted in 3rd world countries that are generally too poor to afford period products have shown a higher percentage of girls skipping schools. In uganda many girls skip school just to avoid getting teased while they are on their period. In sub-saharan Africa, girls miss almost 20% of the school year. We need to educate more people about the proper way to take care of themselves when they have a period and it's a natural things. Girls shouldn’t be shamed for something that occurs to 800 million people daily. It is a normal thing that both girls and boys should be educated and respectful about.</p>

  <div id="Taxes on Menstrual Products">
    <h2>Taxes on Menstrual Products</h2>
    <p>Many people around the world can’t afford menstrual products because sometimes it comes down to the matter of purchasing food or menstrual supplies. There are additional taxes on female hygiene products which uses these products even less accessible than they already are. One of them is known as the tampon tax or “pink tax.” These taxes of targeting minorities and it also allow and encourage gender-based discrimination. By removing this tax it will make it easier for only a small percentage of people to afford these supplies. There will still be many who can’t afford them. In Bangladesh, most families can’t afford period products so they just uses old clothes as a replacement, according to (UNICEF). It is reported than in India only 12% of menstruators have access to sanitary products. The other 88% are still vulnerable to period proverty affecting them and their future kids.</p>

  <div id="Disabillity">
    <h2>People with disabilities</h2>
    <p>Not only people living in poverty have trouble accessing period products, but people of disabilities does not have access to products, facilities, and resources to help out in their daily lives, especially during their menstrual cycle. Period is a topic that is quite because it seems to be a taboo topic in society, but people need to speak out because we need to consider for people with disabilities, people living in conflicted-affected areas, or in the aftermath of a natural disaster, having already such a difficult time to access sanitary products. The government should help take responsibility to provide everyone with sanitary products as a rights of humanity.</p>
    </div>
  <div id="LGBTQ+ community">
    <h2>LGBTQ+ Community</h2>
    <p>A huge minority group that usually gets overlooked isthe LGBTQ+ Community. In our society we tend to think that a person's gender is based on their reproductive organs,but it's not all true because not all people who have periods are women. As already known the cost and accessibility of period products is a big issue for many, also period symptoms can really get tough on some people's life, interfering in everyday business. Transgender people are more likley to live in poverty compared to other people so menstrual products is already a economical barrier for many. Besides it being an economical issue, some people face gender dysphoria which can take a mental toll on people who may experience menstruation despite how they wish their body to function. In addition to the mental health toll that transgender peope may face, they also have to deal with violence and fear of being someone who goes through the menstrual cycle while they identify as men. Most people are not educated enough to know that menstruation shouldn’t only be associated with women and isn’t taboo.</p>
